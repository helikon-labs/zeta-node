## Intro

Zeta Protocol [parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains) implementation in Rust,
built on the [Polkadot SDK Parachain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template).

## Code Structure

This implementation consists of:

- 🧮 the [Runtime](./runtime/README.md) - the core logic of the parachain.
- 🎨 the [Pallets](./pallets/README.md) - from which the runtime is constructed.
- 💿 a [Node](./node/README.md) - the binary application, not part of the project default-members list and not compiled unless
  building the project with `--workspace` flag, which builds all workspace members, and is an alternative to
  [Omni Node](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/omni_node/index.html).

## Getting Started

Fetch code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/helikon-labs/zeta-node.git
cd zeta-node
```

## Starting a Development Chain

### Omni Node Prerequisites

[Omni Node](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/omni_node/index.html) can
be used to run the parachain template's runtime. `polkadot-omni-node` binary crate usage is described at a high-level
[on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/polkadot-omni-node).

#### Install `polkadot-omni-node`

```sh
cargo install polkadot-omni-node
```

> For more advanced options, please see the installation section at [`crates.io/omni-node`](https://crates.io/crates/polkadot-omni-node).

#### Build `zeta-runtime`

```sh
cargo build --profile production
```

#### Install `staging-chain-spec-builder`

```sh
cargo install staging-chain-spec-builder
```

> For more advanced options, please see the installation section at [`crates.io/staging-chain-spec-builder`](https://crates.io/crates/staging-chain-spec-builder).

#### Use `chain-spec-builder` to generate the `chain_spec.json` file

```sh
chain-spec-builder create --relay-chain "rococo-local" --runtime \
    target/release/wbuild/zeta-runtime/zeta_runtime.wasm named-preset development
```

**Note**: the `relay-chain` flag is required by Omni Node. The `relay-chain` value is set in accordance
with the relay chain ID where this instantiation of parachain-template will connect to.

#### Run Omni Node

Start Omni Node with the generated chain spec. We'll start it in development mode (without a relay chain config), producing
and finalizing blocks based on manual seal, configured below to seal a block with each second.

```bash
polkadot-omni-node --chain <path/to/chain_spec.json> --dev --dev-block-time 1000
```

However, such a setup is not close to what would run in production, and for that we need to setup a local
relay chain network that will help with the block finalization. In this guide we'll setup a local relay chain
as well. We'll not do it manually, by starting one node at a time, but we'll use [zombienet](https://paritytech.github.io/zombienet/intro.html).

Follow through the next section for more details on how to do it.

### Zombienet setup with Omni Node

Assuming we continue from the last step of the previous section, we have a chain spec and we need to setup a relay chain.
We can install `zombienet` as described [here](https://paritytech.github.io/zombienet/install.html#installation), and
`zombienet-omni-node.toml` contains the network specification we want to start.

#### Relay chain prerequisites

Download the `polkadot` (and the accompanying `polkadot-prepare-worker` and `polkadot-execute-worker`) binaries from
[Polkadot SDK releases](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases). Then expose them on `PATH` like so:

```sh
export PATH="$PATH:<path/to/binaries>"
```

#### Update `zombienet-omni-node.toml` with a valid chain spec path

To simplify the process of using the node with zombienet and Omni Node, we've added a pre-configured
development chain spec (dev_chain_spec.json) to the parachain template. The zombienet-omni-node.toml file of this
template points to it, but you can update it to an updated chain spec generated on your machine. To generate a
chain spec refer to [staging-chain-spec-builder](https://crates.io/crates/staging-chain-spec-builder)

Then make the changes in the network specification like so:

```toml
# ...
[[parachains]]
id = "<PARACHAIN_ID>"
chain_spec_path = "<TO BE UPDATED WITH A VALID PATH>"
# ...
```

#### Start the network

```sh
zombienet --provider native spawn zombienet-omni-node.toml
```

### Parachain Template Node

As mentioned in the `Code Structure` section, the `node` crate is optionally compiled and it is an alternative
to `Omni Node`. Similarly, it requires setting up a relay chain, and we'll use `zombienet` once more.

#### Install `zeta-node`

```sh
cargo install --path node --locked
```

#### Setup and start the network

For setup, please consider the instructions for `zombienet` installation [here](https://paritytech.github.io/zombienet/install.html#installation)
and [relay chain prerequisites](#relay-chain-prerequisites).

We're left just with starting the network:

```sh
zombienet --provider native spawn zombienet.toml
```

### Connect with the Polkadot-JS Apps Front-End

- 🌐 You can interact with your local node using the
  hosted version of the Polkadot/Substrate Portal:
  [relay chain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944)
  and [parachain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9988).

- 🪐 A hosted version is also
  available on [IPFS](https://dotapps.io/).

- 🧑‍🔧 You can also find the source code and instructions for hosting your own instance in the
  [`polkadot-js/apps`](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) repository.

### Takeaways

Development parachains:

- 🔗 Connect to relay chains, and we showcased how to connect to a local one.
- 🧹 Do not persist the state.
- 💰 Are preconfigured with a genesis state that includes several prefunded development accounts.
- 🧑‍⚖️ Development accounts are used as validators, collators, and `sudo` accounts.

## Runtime development

We recommend using [`chopsticks`](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks) when the focus is more on the runtime
development and `OmniNode` is enough as is.

### Install chopsticks

To use `chopsticks`, please install the latest version according to the installation [guide](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks?tab=readme-ov-file#install).

### Build a raw chain spec

Build the `zeta-runtime` as mentioned before in this guide and use `chain-spec-builder`
again but this time by passing `--raw-storage` flag:

```sh
chain-spec-builder create --raw-storage --relay-chain "rococo-local" --runtime \
    target/release/wbuild/zeta-runtime/zeta_runtime.wasm named-preset development
```

### Start `chopsticks` with the chain spec

```sh
npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest --chain-spec <path/to/chain_spec.json>
```

### Alternatives

`OmniNode` can be still used for runtime development if using the `--dev` flag, while `zeta-node` doesn't
support it at this moment. It can still be used to test a runtime in a full setup where it is started alongside a
relay chain network.
